A gravitational anomaly caused the two planets to collide, scattering the Pygmies among the ruined rubble of their former homes. With so little space to exist, each successive generation of the Pygmy race became physically smaller, but the desire to grow their empire never diminished. The inhospitable chunks of debris on which the Pygmies now live serve only as a staging ground for their invasion of other worlds.","en":"When the Cosmos was young, the Pygmies were quite large, living on twin worlds, rich with valuable resources.
